# Whitelist

This document outlines the process for adding or removing players from the whitelist.

Also refer to the [governance overview](README.md#overview).

The addition or removal of players from the whitelist will follow the same process as changes to server configuration. Any player may propose the addition of a player to the group. As long as there is no objection to the addition of the player by any current player, they will be added to the whitelist.

The removal of a player has not yet been necessary so there is currently no precedent for it.
